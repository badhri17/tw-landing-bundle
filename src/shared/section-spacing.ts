/**
 * المسافات حول القسم — Section spacing.
 *
 * One vertical rhythm for the whole page, expressed as a tier per edge rather
 * than a pixel value. Padding, never margin, for three reasons:
 *
 *  1. Each section paints its own background, so a margin would put the gap
 *     OUTSIDE the paint and expose the merchant's theme colour at every
 *     boundary — which breaks the single page-base background.
 *  2. Adjacent vertical margins collapse (64 below + 40 above = 64, not 104),
 *     so half the merchant's settings would silently do nothing. Padding never
 *     collapses.
 *  3. The bleeding decorations (gallery's strip, faq's side element,
 *     ingredients' orbit) live inside `overflow: clip visible`; padding gives
 *     them room inside the section, a margin gives them none.
 *
 * ⚠️ The visible gap between two stacked sections is the FIRST one's bottom plus
 * the SECOND one's top. That doubling is not a bug and it already existed with
 * the hard-coded values; it is why each edge is its own field, so a merchant can
 * zero one side to pull two sections flush.
 *
 * A tier resolves through two tables, not one: desktop sections are far taller,
 * so the same tier has to mean more room there. This is the pattern documented
 * for relative tiers (see CARD_SCALE_MOBILE / CARD_SCALE_DESKTOP in
 * product-features) — the merchant picks a rhythm once and it scales.
 *
 * Shared by every landing section, so the custom properties are deliberately
 * un-prefixed (`--sp-*`): each component renders into its own shadow root, so
 * there is nothing to collide with, and the CSS is then identical everywhere.
